## 📚 Libraries

- **TensorFlow / Keras** — Model building, training, saving, and loading.
- **scikit-learn** — Utilities for train/test splitting and shuffling data.
- **NumPy** — Data manipulation.
- **OpenCV** — Image preprocessing: resizing, color conversion, bitwise operations.
- **Matplotlib** — Visualizing images and plotting loss/accuracy graphs.
- **Pickle** — Saving/loading machine learning models (use cautiously for Keras models).
- Other Keras modules: layers, optimizers, callbacks (EarlyStopping).
